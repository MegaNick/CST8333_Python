# PythonWorkspace
This is working directory of my Python project for CST8333 course in Algonquin College. Using given .csv dataset I created a GUI
interface using Tkinter which allows some basic manipulations.
The folder also has some course exercises and some working material I had during my studies.
This project was sufficient to pass the course requirements. 

Necessary files:
MAJOR.py - the body of the program

unittesting.py - unittest modules (not suited) for the project

The dataset for manipulations should be taken from here: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a683c640-b5fd-48f8-a0f1-d619b8f7e04c

God bless!
