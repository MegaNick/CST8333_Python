# PythonWorkspace
This is working directory of my Python project for CST8333 course in Algonquin College. Using given .csv dataset I created a GUI
interface using Tkinter which allows some basic manipulations.
The folder also has some course exercises and some working material I had during my studies.
This project was sufficient to pass the course requirements.
